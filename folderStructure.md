# Structuring Your Medium-Sized React Project: A Clean Architecture Approach

As your project grows from a simple idea into a complex application, the structure of your codebase can either be a robust foundation or a tangled mess slowing you down. For those navigating the waters of a medium-sized React project, particularly when working solo with TypeScript, adopting a Clean Architecture approach might just be the key to maintaining sanity. This blog post delves into the rationale behind organizing your project in such a manner and provides a guide for future maintainers of the code.

## Why Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture, at its core, emphasizes separation of concerns. It's about dividing your project in a way that each part has a clear responsibility and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This not only makes your code more reusable and scalable but also ensures that changes in one area of your project have minimal impact on others.

For a React project, this means segregating your application into distinct layers: 

- **Core Business Logic** (entities, use cases)
- **Adapters** (APIs, external interfaces)
- **Presentation** (UI components, pages)

## Proposed Project Structure

```
/src
  /app
    /core
      /entities
      /useCases
    /infrastructure
      /api
      /storage
    /ui
      /components
      /features
        /FeatureName
          /components
          /hooks
          /types
          /services
          index.tsx
      /pages
      /hooks
      /styles
  /assets
  /types
index.tsx
```

### Core (`/app/core`)
This layer is the heart of your application, focusing on business rules and logic. It is independent of the web framework you use, thus making your business logic testable in isolation.

- **Entities** are your domain models, representing the data and behavior of your application independently of the UI.
- **Use Cases** encapsulate specific business processes or actions your application needs to perform.

### Infrastructure (`/app/infrastructure`)
Here lies the code for external interfaces and adapters, like API calls or local storage access. This layer acts as a bridge between the core logic and the outside world.

- **API** functions abstract away the HTTP requests to external services.
- **Storage** utilities manage persistence, such as browser storage or cookies.

### UI (`/app/ui`)
The UI layer is where your React components live. It's structured to promote reuse and maintainability.

- **Components** are the reusable building blocks of your UI, like buttons and input fields.
- **Features** contain all code specific to a feature, including its components, hooks, types, and services.
- **Pages** assemble components and features to form complete pages.

### Assets and Types
- **Assets** (`/assets`) store static files like images and icons.
- **Types** (`/types`) hold global TypeScript definitions, ensuring type safety across your application.

## Rationale and Instructions for Future Developers

1. **Maintainability**: This structure makes it easy to locate and update specific parts of your application without wading through unrelated code.
2. **Scalability**: As new features are added, this modular approach allows you to expand your application systematically without restructuring existing code.
3. **Reusability**: By isolating UI components and business logic, you can easily reuse code across different parts of your application or even in new projects.

### Guidelines for Future Keepers

- **Consistency is Key**: Stick to the established patterns when adding new features or making changes. This ensures that the codebase remains navigable and understandable for anyone new to the project.
- **Think Modular**: Before adding new code, consider if it can be isolated or made more generic to enhance reusability.
- **Document Decisions**: When making significant architectural decisions or introducing new patterns, document your rationale. This will help future developers understand the context behind these choices.

## Conclusion

Adopting a Clean Architecture approach for your React project can greatly enhance its long-term maintainability and scalability. By clearly separating concerns and maintaining a consistent structure, you lay a solid foundation for both current and future development efforts. Remember, the ultimate goal is to create a codebase that is not only functional but also a joy to work with. Happy coding!
